  abstract={Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets have become the standard for securing cryptocurrency assets, but the February 2025 Bybit breach revealed a critical vulnerability: blind signing. This work presents ZKML-Guard, a framework merging Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) with MPC custody architecture to enable verifiable risk assessment of transactions without exposing sensitive information or proprietary models. Our transaction classification model achieves 94.7\% accuracy with 847ms median proof generation time. The system would have detected the Bybit attack vector with 99.2\% confidence while maintaining a 0.3\% false positive rate.},
